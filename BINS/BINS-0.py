'''
The problem is to find a given set of keys in a given array.

Given: Two positive integers n≤10^5 and m≤10^5, a sorted array A[1..n] of integers
from −10^5 to 10^5 and a list of m integers −10^5≤k1,k2,…,km≤10^5.

Return: For each ki, output an index 1≤j≤n s.t. A[j]=ki or "-1" if there is no such index.
